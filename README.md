# **Introduction**
This analysis delves into the Sales performance of NorthWind Traders, leveraging data from various tables within the NorthWind database. The examination includes data from the orderID, customerID, employeeID, orderDate, requiredDate, shippedDate, shipperID, freight, productID, productName, quantityPerUnit, unitPrice, categoryID, categoryName, description, companyName, contactName, contactTitle, city, and country tables. The data was imported into Excel and Power BI for comprehensive analysis.

It's important to note that NorthWind Traders is not a real company; rather, it's a database created for educational purposes by Microsoft.
# **Problem Statement**

The objective of this analysis is to:

1. **Calculate Total Sales by Product Category:** Determine the total sales (revenue) generated for each category of products to understand the contribution of each category to overall sales.

2. **Identify Customer with Highest Order Count:** Determine which customer has placed the highest number of orders to identify key customers driving sales volume.

3. **Calculate Total Sales by Employee:** Analyze the total sales generated by each employee to assess individual sales performance and contribution.

4. **Analyze Sales Trends Over Time:** Show the trend in sales over time to identify patterns, seasonality, or trends in sales performance.

5. **Calculate Average Order Processing Time:** Calculate the average time it takes to process an order from the order date to the shipped date to optimize order fulfillment processes and improve customer satisfaction.

Additionally, this analysis will utilize Power BI to create a top-level KPI dashboard for the executive team. The dashboard aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the company's performance in key areas, including:

- **Sales Trends:** Visualize trends in sales over time to track performance and identify areas for growth.
  
- **Product Performance:** Analyze the performance of products to identify top-selling products and opportunities for product optimization.

- **Key Customers:** Identify key customers based on sales volume and engagement to prioritize relationship-building efforts.
