# NorthWind_Traders
This project showcases my proficiency in querying data from the NorthWind Traders database using Excel. Subsequently, I imported the queried data into Power BI for analysis and visualization. Through this project, I demonstrate my ability to extract insights from complex datasets and present them in an accessible and visually engaging manner.
